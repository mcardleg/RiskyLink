<center><h1>Alignment API: To our Maven users</h1></center>

<p>
The Alignment API is not a native Maven project.
It is built using Ant.
There are reason for that: we think that maven is putting too much hassle to developpers with respect to delivered benefits.
</p>
<p>
However, we have no reason to not help our Maven users as long as this is not too difficult.
</p>

<h2>Adding the Alignment API to a local repository</h2>

<p>
Since the Alignment API jar files have readble POM files, it is possible to add them to a local repository even if you use the Maven central repository otherwise. This can be achieved by:
<div class="terminal">
$ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=${DIR}/lib/align.jar -DpomFile=${DIR}/lib/align.pom -Dpackaging=jar
$ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=${DIR}/lib/procalign.jar -DpomFile=${DIR}/lib/procalign.pom -Dpackaging=jar
$ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=${DIR}/lib/ontowrap.jar -DpomFile=${DIR}/lib/ontowrap.pom -Dpackaging=jar
$ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=${DIR}/lib/alignsvc.jar -DpomFile=${DIR}/lib/alignsvc.pom -Dpackaging=jar
</div>
such that ${DIR} is the directory in which the Alignment API has been compiled.
</p>

<h2>Generating a local repository</h2>

<p>
The same can be achieved from ant.
One can generate a local maven repository by simply applying:
<div class="terminal">
$ ant mavenize
Buildfile: /Java/alignapi/build.xml

bind:

init:

mavenize:
     [echo] Mavenizing...
   [delete] Deleting directory /Java/alignapi/mvn-repo
    [mkdir] Created dir: /Java/alignapi/mvn-repo
[artifact:install] [INFO] Installing /Java/alignapi/lib/align.jar to /Java/alignapi/mvn-repo/org/semanticweb/owl/align/4.4/align-4.4.jar
            ...

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 second
</div>
This will generate a directory <tt>mvn-repo</tt> which is a local maven repository. 
</p>
<p>
It can be used in your project <!--tt>settings.xml</tt> by including:
<div class="rdfxml">
&lt;localRepository>mvn-repo&lt;/localRepository>
</div>
or in you project--> POM, by including:
<div class="rdfxml">
  &lt;repository>
    &lt;id>in-project&lt;/id>
    &lt;name>local maven repository&lt;/name>
    &lt;url>file://${project.basedir}/mvn-repo&lt;/url>
  &lt;/repository>

</div>
</p>
<p>
This is obtained by using the maven-ant-tasks ant plug-ins, but it is equivalent to the command lines:
<div class="terminal">
$ mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=mvn-repo install:install-file -Dfile=lib/align.jar -DpomFile=lib/align.pom -Dpackaging=jar
...
</div>
</p>

<h2>About POM files</h2><a name="pom"></a>

<p>
We are using the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/pom.html">POM format</a>, not exactly as Maven but as a practical
way to record information about shipped libraries. We ship 
<a href="lib.html">external libraries</a> because we want users to be
ready to work right away.
</p>
<p>
Included libraries and associated POM files are maintained by hand.
They do not contain dependency information because we think that the
way Maven maintains dependency information both in the POM file, in
the directory structure and in the JAR name is too much. Moreover, we
think that maintaining this information at the exact version level
defeats the purpose of modular software.
</p>
<p>
The Alignment API POM files themselves are generated on the fly from
ant from the templates found in the <tt>distrib</tt> repository.
</p>

<h2>We need your help</h2>

<p>
Any constructive feedback for improving the process, improving the
content of our POM files (especially if it is for allowing you to do
better things) is welcome.
</p>
<p>
If you know of a good way to replace some component of our local
repository by officially well maintained versions of global repository
we want to hear you. If you know how to generate better Alignment API
POM files, we want to hear you.
</p>
<p>
The best for us is if you can just do it (particularly in ant or
shell, but even maven command lines should be OK) and send us the procedure.
</p>
<p>
If you want to publish the Alignment API in a repository, then you are
welcome, but in the current state of Maven and its repositories, do
not count on us to maintain it.
